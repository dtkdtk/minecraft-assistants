### How does the AI ​​bot work

The principle of the AI ​​bot is based on processing tasks (jobs).
The brain is responsible for managing tasks, and the intelligence modules are responsible for providing the logic for their execution.

The brain contains a prioritized queue of tasks. The bot performs the task with the highest priority.
